Note:
+ Just like Phones are not just mini-computers
+ You need to design differently for phones
    + Quick actions
    + Notifications
    + Minimal input
+ Watch -> Phone -> PC :: Tweet -> FB Post -> Blog Post
    + Tweet is like a summary of your blog post
    + FB post is like your outline
    + Both come before writing the whole post
    + Design from small to large (Mobile-first; watch-first?)
+ Context-first
    + Think about HOW people will use the device
    + Google Translate
+ Pic is Seiko Wrist Computer
    + UC 2000 Wrist Computer
    + Disconnect watch and wear without terminal
    + Compatible with Apple, Commodore 64, IBM PCs, etc.
    + $300 (now $635)
