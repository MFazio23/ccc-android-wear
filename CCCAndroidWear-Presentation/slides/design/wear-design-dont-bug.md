Note:
+ Don't be a shoulder tapper
+ Since the watch is right on a person, don't vibrate the watch as much
+ "Next time youâ€™re in a conversation, imagine someone tapping you on your shoulder, interrupting you with the information you want your app to deliver. If the information delivered did not justify suspending a conversation, you should not make the notification interruptive."
